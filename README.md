# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Getting started:

If you are correctly in the folder which you are using to create vite

1.clone the repo using the ssh/http protocol into your folder/ download the zip folder and open in code editor and cd folder_name

     npm install
     
(for non production code)
      
      npm run dev 

If you are creating new project through vite

     npm create vite@latest my-vue-app -- --template vue

    npm install

(for non production code)

     npm run dev 


Pros:

Developed user friendly interface 
Used Driver.js for website tour and Understanding of the functionalities
Added lottifiles poppers to display the sucessful request(since database is not acceseble it refer section doesnt submit).
All the refer button is functionalble
Added Client validation for Email and Name

Cons:

Not responsive only suitable for device above 1000px since some of the content are images and since there is no particular design to work with.
All buttons except refer button is Non functional since the router is not set or currently does not need aythentication or any other functionalities
